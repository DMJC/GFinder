GFinder is a fork of GNUstep's Workspace Manager aiming to implement a more modern Mac-Like experience and offers a File Manager and an optional Desktop with associated services and tools.
Inspired by the OSX Finder, it incorporates modern features and offers many conveniencies.

File Manager:
     * Icons view set by default
     * Horizontal shortcuts modelled after Apple's Finder.
     * Classical column browser view
     * List view
     * Icons view with possibility of Thumbnails

Recycler (stand-alone or integrated in Desktop's Dock)

Desktop (can be shown or hidden) with Dock and Tabbed shelf to keep order in favourites and running applications.

Contents inspector with image previewing and extensible through plug-in bundles.

Volume checking and unmounting.

Optional search (database backed) and live folders.

GFinder implements NSWorkspace, so it offers to GNUstep applications services to open files through it as well as copy and recycle operations.
